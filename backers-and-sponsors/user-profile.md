# User Profile

You can use your Open Collective user profile to let people know a bit about you. Projects you back might want to reach out to you, or you may want to use this page to show off your contributions.

There are a lot of options you can access by clicking "edit profile", including editing your info, images, payment methods, connected accounts, and more.
