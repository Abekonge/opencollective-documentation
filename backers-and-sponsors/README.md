# Backers & Sponsors

## FAQ

### Why should I give to a Collective?

If you get value out of what a project produces, support them to maintain it well and make improvements. You can also get recognition by appearing on their page as a backer or sponsor.

### How do I contribute financially to a Collective?

Go to the Collective page of the project you want to support. Select a contribution tier and set up a recurring donation, or click "one time donation" to make a one-off payment.

### How can I find Collectives to support?

Check out the [Discover](https://opencollective.com/discover) page or do a search.

You can also find dependencies using [Back Your Stack](https://backyourstack.com/).

### What payment methods can I use?

Right now we only support credit card payments via Stripe through the platform. It is possible to pay by other means, such as bank transfer or Paypal, by special agreement with a Collective and their [Fiscal Host](../hosts/).
