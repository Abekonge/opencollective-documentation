### Why Create an Organization

* Have your organization show up as a sponsor of a Collective
* Enable your employees to support Collectives on behalf of your company

### How to Create an Organization

1. Log out of your personal Open Collective profile
2. Visit the Collective you want to sponsor
3. Select a contribution tier
4. Under "contribute as" select "create organization"
5. Complete the contribution
6. You'll be redirected to a profile page, but it won't be editable yet because your account is not activated
7. Open Collective will send you an activation email

Now you will be redirected to a profile page where you wont be able to edit it's content because you need to login first.

Give our database some minutes while it processes your new organization profile. To be sure, give it around 10 minutes, otherwise it will ask you to create a user with the email you used to create the organization \(you don't want that\).

Now, head to your email inbox, you should have received an email like this:

Click on "clicking here" hyperlink to log in with the email you provided \(circled above\). Make sure you are logged out of other profiles.

You are now taken to a profile created for the email that was used to create the organization, this is not the organization profile, but you can edit it to customize it.

On that same profile if you scroll down you will see the "collectives" you are supporting, in this case it means the "Organization" you manage.

You can also use the top right corner menu to head directly to the organization profile.

Click on the name of your organization, my example is in Spanish, but your organization should also be under the "discover" legend.

### Edit Your Organization

Head to the top right menu to navigate to your Organization profile. 

\(Make sure you're logged into the account your Organization is under, not your personal account, if they are different.\)

Click "edit organization".

* **Info:** name, description, website, twitter
* **Images:** logo and cover picture
* **Members:** add organization members
* **Payment methods:** View, edit and change payment methods \(credit cards\), and set a monthly spending limit
* **Advanced:** change your Organization's URL

Don't forget to click save!
