# Payments

### Save a new card for future transactions

Go to manage payment methods in your profile settings and select "add another payment option". If you add a new card, you will have it as an option to make future contributions.

> **Note:** Adding a new card does not change the card for existing recurring contributions.

### Change payment method for existing subscription

To change payment method for an existing subscription, you need to cancel and re-do it. Click "subscriptions" in your user menu and find the subscription. Click the three dot menu next to it and cancel the subscription. Then go back to the Collective and set up a new contribution with your new card.

### Cancel a Subscription

If you have set up a repeating payment to a Collective, such as a monthly contribution, and you want to cancel it, here's how. Under your user menu, go to Subscriptions. Find the one you want to cancel and click the little three dot menu. Select 'cancel'.

### Change the amount of a Subscription

Unfortunately we don't have an easy way to do this. You'll need to cancel the existing subscription and set up a new one. Click "subscriptions" in your user menu and find the subscription. Click the three dot menu next to it and cancel the subscription. Then go back to the Collective and set up a new contribution.
