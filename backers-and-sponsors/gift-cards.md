See our dedicated [Gift Cards](https://opencollective.com/gift-cards) page for more details.

Open Collective gift cards empower your employees or community members to support the open source projects they love.

You can give us a list of emails and we'll send the gift cards out, or you can generate gift card codes and send them out yourself.

To create Gift Cards for your [Organization](organizations.md), go to 'edit organization' and then 'gift cards'.
