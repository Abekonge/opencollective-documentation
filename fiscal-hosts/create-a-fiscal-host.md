You will then have access to all Fiscal host settings, such as whether you want to be open to applications from Collectives, your host fee, etc.

Don't forget to go to **Receiving Money** and activate a method for people to give money to your Collectives, either credit cards \(via Stripe\) and/or bank transfers.
