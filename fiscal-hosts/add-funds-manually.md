# Add Funds Manually

{% hint style="warning" %}
[In January of 2020](https://blog.opencollective.com/new-host-plans), we introduced new paid plans for Fiscal Hosts. Adding funds received through other channels is **free up to $1000 across Collectives** for Fiscal Hosts ****on the **Starter** plan. After you've reached that limit, you will need to upgrade your plan.
{% endhint %}

You can manually add funds to a Collective directly. This is useful when you receive a donation for a Collective outside the Open Collective system \(like a bank transfer\) and want to apply it to a Collective's budget.

Log in and go to your [Fiscal Host dashboard](fiscal-host-dashboard.md). Click on the **Hosted Collectives** tab.

 Use the search bar to find the Collective you want to add funds for.

And fill the form with all required information to add the funds to that Collective with the following information:

![The form to manually add funds to a Collective.](../.gitbook/assets/fiscal-hosts-add-funds-manually-addition-form-2020-09-18.png)

* The **amount** of funds you want to send to a Collective.
* Your **host fee**, which is the you charge your Collectives. It's already set to your default, but you change it to an one-time fee of your preference.
* A short **description** of those funds.
* The **source** of those funds. It can be your Fiscal Host, another Collective, or an Organization.

Once you're done, just click on **Add Funds**.
