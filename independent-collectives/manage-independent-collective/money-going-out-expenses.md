# Money going out: Expenses

To spend money from your Collective balance, the payee needs to [submit an expense](../../expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses.md). 

To see all expenses for your Collective, click that menu item under 'Budget'.

## Approving Expenses

Once submitted, the expense is pending. You or another admin of your Collective have the power to approve or reject expenses. Expenses must be approved by an admin before payment.

Click on the expense to see details about what it's for, who submitted it, associated receipts, etc. It's up to you to set the requirements for expenses to be approved.

## Paying Expenses

Once approved, you can click "Go to Pay".

The payment options depend on what payout method the payee has selected and whether or not you have connected your Wise and/or PayPal accounts in the 'Sending Money' section of your settings.

If you have connected Wise and/or PayPal, you can pay with one click through those payment processors.

If you have not connected these accounts through Open Collective, or simply wish to process them manually, select the manual option \(if you haven't connected any payment processors manual will be the only option\).

You can add any payment processor fees here, and they will be debited from the Collective balance along with the principle payment amount.

## Historical Expenses

If you wish to represent expenses previously paid for transparency, but don't need to actually move any money or track the actual payees, you can select the Collective itself as the payee of an expense. This will simply debit the balance and record the details of the expense on Open Collective.

## Platform Settlement Expenses

This is a special type of expense created when you owe Open Collective money, which arise because of platform tips. Platform tips are an optional contribution that payers can make during checkout on top of the amount they are contributing to your Collective. 

If that payment goes through Stripe, the tip is automatically diverted to Open Collective and you don't need to do anything. But if it's part of a bank transfer transaction, the tip will arrive in your bank account along with the contribution to your Collective.

You also have the option to add a platform tip when [adding funds manually](money-coming-in-contributions.md#add-funds-manually). By definition, this represents money already sitting in your bank account, so Open Collective has to submit an expense to receive it from you.

If you need to pass on any platform tips, a Platform Settlement Expense will automatically appear once per month, and you can proceed to approve and pay it like any other expense.
