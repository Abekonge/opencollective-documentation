# Migrate from a Fiscal Host to Independent Collective

Want to be responsible for your own tax, hold your funds in your bank account and save money on fees? Migrate from being fiscally hosted to an independent collective.&#x20;

Warning this change will require your current contributors to reconfirm their credit card details. They will receive a request to do so via email.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### How do I migrate?&#x20;

If you have a Collective which is Fiscally Hosted, here are the steps to change to being an Independent Collective.

1. Go to the settings of the Collective
2. If your Collective has money in its budget, go to Advanced > Empty Collective Balance and click the button to send your balance to the Host (no money moves, it stays in your bank account)
3. Go to Fiscal Host
4. Click 'Remove Host'
5. Select Independent Collective then click the button to activate
6. Go to Receiving Money
7. Connect your Stripe and bank account
8. Go to Info
9. Set the legal name as the owner of the bank account (this might be you personally or your company) - the public display name will still be the name of your Collective as a project, but receipts will be issued from the legal name as the entity receiving the funds
10. If you emptied the balance in step 2:
    1. Go to the Collective page
    2. Click Actions > Add Funds
    3. Add back the balance you removed in step 2, with the Collective itself as the source
