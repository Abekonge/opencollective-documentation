# Close an Independent Collective

If you wish to close down your Independent Collective or change to a different Fiscal Host, here are the steps to take.

1. Zero the balance of the Collective, by submitting real expenses to use up the money, or submit an expense for the purpose of zeroing the balance.
2. Go to Settings > Fiscal Host > Reset Fiscal Host
3. From here you can either
   * [Apply to or create a new Fiscal Host](../collectives/add-fiscal-host.md), retaining your Collective's history, database of supporters who receive your Updates, and any recurring contributions, or 
   * Proceed to [close down your Collective](../collectives/collective-settings/closing-a-collective.md).
