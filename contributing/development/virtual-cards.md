3\. Connect to the database with your favorite tool (psql, DBeaver, Postico, etc.) and search for the host you want to enable Privacy for. Edit its `settings` to set `features.privacyVcc` to `true`

4\. Open the host settings and go to the "Fiscal host settings" > "Sending Money" section

5\. Paste your API Key in the "API Key" field and click on "Connect Privacy".
