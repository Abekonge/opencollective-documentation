# Expenses & Getting Paid

## FAQ

### How do I get paid from a Collective?

Go to the page of the Collective and click "Submit Expense". You will need to upload a valid receipt or invoice, and provide your PayPal address.

### How are expenses approved?

Anyone can file an expense to any Collective \(in the same way that anyone can make a pull request to any open source project\). To be paid, it must be approved by one of the Core Contributors of the Collective. 

Please ensure your expense meets the expense policy of the Collective, which appears on the 'submit expense' form. If you modify an expense, it will have to be approved again. Once paid, it cannot be modified.

### Are receipts or invoices public?

Basic data for all expenses, like the amount and description, are public. But attachments like invoices are private, as they may contain personal information. Only the administrators of the Collective and of the Fiscal Host can see invoices and receipt details.

### When will I get paid?

Expenses for Collectives in Fiscal Hosts managed by Open Collective are paid weekly, on Thursdays. Other hosts have their own policies and schedules.

### Can I get paid by a method other than Paypal?

If the Collective is fiscally hosted by Open Collective \(e.g. the Open Source Collective\), probably not. Right now our system only is able to send outgoing payments using Paypal. 

Payments through other forms, such as bank transfer, must be made manually, and we're only able to do that for special circumstances, such as a user located in a country Paypal does not serve, or very large amounts being transferred.  

We hope to add more choices for automated payments in the future, including bank transfer, cryptocurrency, and other payment platforms.

If the Collective is fiscally hosted by an entity not managed by Open Collective, contact them directly to find out their policy.
