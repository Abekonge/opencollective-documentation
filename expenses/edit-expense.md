# Edit Expense

Unapproved expenses can be edits by the user who [submitted](submitting-expenses.md) them and the [Fiscal Host](../hosts/) admin. Once an expense has been approved by a Collective core contributor, it can only be edited by the Fiscal Host admin.

If you have entered incorrect information on your expense and it has not yet been approved, you can click "edit" to fix the error. Remember to save your changes.

If you need to edit an expense that's already been approved, you can put a comment on the expense explaining the situation. 

The Collective core contributor can reject your expense so you can re-do it, or the host admin can kick it back to unapproved status. If you edit a previously approved expense, it will need to be approved again before payment.

Once you have made your edits, click the "save" button.
