# Documentation

The Open Collective Documentation is our main documentation enabling all of our users to successfully use our platform.&#x20;

We encourage our [fiscal hosts](https://opencollective.com/hosts) to link out to our main documentation for the basic how-to-use of Open Collective. We will also aim to link out to our fiscal host's documentation in specific areas to provide further information when needed.&#x20;

If you are looking for more specific Fiscal Host Documentation, please head along to the links below.&#x20;
