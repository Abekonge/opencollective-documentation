# Community Guidelines

**We are a community based on trust, transparency, and contribution. In order to keep it that way, we expect everyone to act in accordance with these guidelines, including all Collectives, Backers, Sponsors, and our own Open Collective team.**

## **Be Authentic**

Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community. We're all in this together, please act respectfully, honestly, and mission-aligned when using our site.

## **Be honest**

Be honest about who you are, what your Collective is doing, why you are fundraising, and what you want to do with the funds. Dishonesty is not only damaging to you, but to all Collectives. Do not be the one bringing mistrust into the community.

To potential donors: Respect the right of collectives to build their own community. This includes their right to decide who should be a member and consequently to refuse donations.

If your intention of donating is for any other purpose than to support the mission of the initiative \(i.e. self-promotion\), your donation can be refused \(reimbursed\) and removed from a collective’s page.

## **Be inclusive**

The reason we can do great things together is that each of us brings a different point of view. Whoever you are, you have a unique perspective and skillset to contribute. Be open to those who you want to contribute genuinely.

## **Be respectful**

We have zero tolerance for unacceptable behavior. Being a jerk will not get you a place in this community; it will turn people away. We do not want that noise in the system. If your account is found to be engaged in any kind of unacceptable behavior, we can close it.

Unacceptable behaviors include but are not limited: spamming, trolling, intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our community online, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business.

Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images \(including presentation slides\); inappropriate depictions of violence \(including presentation slides\); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

## **Be mindful**

Your backers want to hear how you are going and stay connected. But please be respectful of their inboxes and their time. The same goes for your interactions with everyone in the community.

To sponsors, collective members are often volunteers taking time away from their families or free time to grow their communities. Please be mindful of their time and be patient and respectful when reaching out.

## Speak up

If something is wrong, let us know. We believe in self-managing systems, so we do not police or moderate excessively. The only way this works is by sharing the effort of noticing what is going on.

While we give you tools to moderate interactions with your collective, we still rely on you to let us know when something isn’t right. Please contact us any time: [https://opencollective.com/support](https://opencollective.com/support).

## **Share the love**

If you like something, share it with your friends. Let the world know and receive some love in return.

These guidelines will continue to evolve as we grow. It is up to all of us to build an honest, safe and trustworthy community. Thank you for making it real.
