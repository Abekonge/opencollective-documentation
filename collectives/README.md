## FAQ

### What can I do with an Open Collective?

* Collect membership fees and donations \([example](https://opencollective.com/RailsGirlsAtl)\)
* Pay bills and reimburse expenses \([example](https://opencollective.com/RailsGirlsAtl/expenses/new)\)
* Give everyone visibility on your budget \([example](https://opencollective.com/RailsGirlsAtl/expenses)\)

### What is Open Collective good for?

You shouldn't have to worry about incorporating a legal entity and doing bookkeeping just to collect money and spend for a project, and with Open Collective you don't have to. Open Collective is great for all kinds of collaborative groups, like meetups, open source projects, neighborhood associations, clubs, unions, movements, conferences, non-profits, and incubators.

### Why should I use Open Collective?

Open Collective makes it easy to be transparent about your finances. We help you collect recurring or one-off contributions sponsors, backers, or members. Reimbursing expenses from your Open Collective is simple—the person to be paid submits a receipt or invoice, and if you approve it, they get paid. Everyone can see how funds are being spent. We believe that financial transparency creates stronger collaboration.

### How do Collectives spend money?

There are as many answers to this question as there are collectives! It's up to each community to decide how to spend their funds. Some communities delegate financial decision-making to a specific person or role, some develop policies about what should be funded, and others have processes in place to make spending decisions together as a group.

For ideas and examples, check out this article: [Has Your Open Source Community Raised Money? Here’s How to Spend It](https://medium.com/open-collective/has-your-open-source-community-raised-money-heres-how-to-spend-it-3e9dd957dad). 

Some common expenses are hosting costs, documentation, community moderation, printing t-shirts and stickers, conference travel expenses, food at meetups, and time spend working on specific features, or even paying someone to work on a project full time!

For more details about how to spend money, see our documentation about expenses.

### How is it different from other crowdfunding platforms?

* Many crowdfunding campaigns are for one-off projects so once the campaign is over, the community dissipates. Open Collective is designed for ongoing financial support, allowing for better long term planning and an ongoing relationship with your community of backers. 
* Open Collective operates with full financial transparency. Other platforms hand over the money without showing the backers how it's used. We believe transparency leads to healthier organizations and communities. Open Collective is for projects that want to be accountable to their communities. 
* Open Collective is built for collaborative groups. While a Collective can work with just one project admin, you can add as many as you like. There are a lot of projects where it doesn't make sense for an individual to own and control it by themselves. Open Collective makes it clear the project is raising funds, not the person.

### How does it work?

Money contributed to a Collective goes to the bank account of the fiscal host \(see more info about fiscal hosts\). When someone wants to be paid, they submit an expense through your Collective page \(like this one\). After you approve it, the person is reimbursed via PayPal. Expenses are visible publicly, so everyone can see how much money was spent and on what. Private details like emails, names, and addresses are only visible to that user and the Collective admins.

### How much does it cost?

Like most other crowdfunding platforms, Open Collective takes a 5% commission \(plus payment processing fees, approximately 3%\). Another additional fee may apply—often 5%—depending on the fiscal host. 

A fiscal host is the organisation that maintains the bank account behind the scenes, and takes care of bookkeeping, taxes, etc. If you operate an organization that can provide these services, you can fiscally host your own Collective, incurring no fiscal hosting fee. If you want another organization to fiscally host you, a fee might apply.
