# Creating a Collective

Open Collective allows you to create a transparent funding page for your project in just a few clicks. No need to incorporate, hire a lawyer and accountant, or define organizational roles.

You can create an Open Collective for free right now at [**https://www.opencollective.com/create**](https://www.opencollective.com/create)\*\*\*\*

In order to accept and spend money, however, you'll need a [Fiscal Host](../hosts/). 

There are different hosts that serve different missions, interest areas, and geographic. [See them all here](https://opencollective.com/hosts).

Click on "apply to create a collective" on any host page, and if your project fits their criteria, they will approve it. 

If you have a legal entity and bank account already, you can also [set up your own fiscal host](../hosts/become-host.md).

If you are an open source project with at least 100 stars on GitHub \(or equivalent other website\), you can apply to create your Collective under the umbrella of the [Open Source Collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource/apply) fiscal host.

Once your Collective is created, go to "edit Collective". Here you can personalize your page and and write a detailed description. Setting up a Collective is a great opportunity to clarify your mission and explain why people should back you.
