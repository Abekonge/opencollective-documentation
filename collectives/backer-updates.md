# Updates to Backers

A lot of Collectives like to periodically email their Backers, to let them know what their contributions are enabling, express thanks, or notify everyone of a change.

To email all your backers send an email to **backers@$collective.opencollective.com**

_$collective = the name of your Collective, which appears in your Collective URL_

Another option is to [export](data-export.md) the email addresses and send your message directly.
