# Add Fiscal Host

## Options for Fiscal Hosting

In order to raise and spend money, you'll need a bank account associated with your Collective.&#x20;

You can:

1. Join a [Fiscal Host](../fiscal-hosts/fiscal-hosts.md), who will take care of things like accounting, banking, liability, and payments (most Collectives choose this option), or
2. Plug in your own bank account as an [Independent Collective](../independent-collectives/about-independent-collectives.md), or
3. Create [your own Fiscal Host](../fiscal-hosts/become-a-fiscal-host.md) to hold funds for multiple Collectives under the umbrella of your own legal entity.

## How to add a Fiscal Host

There are different hosts that serve different missions, interest areas, and geographic. [See them all here](https://opencollective.com/hosts).

Click on the apply button on any host page, and if your project fits their criteria, they will approve it. (The apply button can sometimes be nestled under the actions button).&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
If you are an open-source project with at least 100 stars on GitHub (or equivalent other websites), you can apply to create your Collective under the umbrella of the [Open Source Collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource/apply) fiscal host.
{% endhint %}

To see your Fiscal Host options, go to your Collective Page, click on the settings button and head to the **Fiscal Host** page.

## Applying to a fiscal host

Fiscal hosts have their own application criteria, which is often based on their location, their mission or impact area and their legal status. For example [Open Collective Foundation](https://opencollective.foundation/) supports projects who are based in the USA and work on civic engagement, education and solidarity initiatives.&#x20;

Applying to a host will require that you answer some questions about your project that help the host asses whether you are appropriate for their organisation.&#x20;

### Host Policies

Hosts also have policies which they will make you aware of during your application, some of these policies are enforced through the Open Collective platform including:&#x20;

#### Minimum number of Admininstrators

Some hosts require that you have a minimum of two of more administrators associated with your Collective. If this is the case you will be asked to invite other administators as part of your application process:
