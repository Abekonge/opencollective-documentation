# \*Budget Transactions

Collectives have transparent budgets, where all transactions are automatically reported. Everyone can see where money comes from and what it's spent on.

Private information is hidden. For example, email addresses and attachments \(which may contain personal information\).

The expenses view shows what the Collective has spent money on. You can see individual expenses and the top categories and people the budget has gone toward.

The transactions view shows the budget lines, and you can filter by credits and debits, or export via CSV.
