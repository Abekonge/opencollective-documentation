{% hint style="warning" %}
This functionality is still in it's experimental phase.
{% endhint %}

## Create an Event

Log in to your Collective and scroll down to the Events section. Click on the **Create Event** button.

![](../.gitbook/assets/collectives\_events\_creating-a-event.png)

* **URL:** the online address your event will have - very important so you don't get a [404 error](events.md#i-cant-see-my-event-listed-or-get-a-404-error).
* **Name** of the event
* **Description:** purpose, schedule, etc. Use something short (less than 255 characters). You'll be able to set a longer description directly on the event page after its creation.
* **Start** date & time
* **End** date & time
* **Location:** the address will load a map

### Tickets & Pricing

You can create several kinds of tickets.

* Type (supporters, sponsor, or ticket)
* Name (eg, gold sponsor, free ticket, donation, etc)
* Description (what the ticket includes or who it's for)
* Amount (price) can be free or you can charge

You can add more tickets with the "add another ticket" button.

#### Add Images

You'll need to host your image somewhere and link to it with markdown syntax. Use this [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images) if you're not sure how. The basic format is:

```
![](https://img.url)
```

The size of the image should be 750 px wide max.

#### Finally, click the "CREATE EVENT" button.

## Edit or Delete an Event

1. Log in to your Collective
2. Click on the events tab
3. Click on the name of the event
4. Click "EDIT" on the event page

You will now be able to edit your event.

To delete, scroll down to the bottom and click "delete event".

### **How can I set an admin for my event?**&#x20;

Events inherit the admins of the Collective.

### **How can I set a longer description?**

You'll be able to set a longer description from your profile page. Scroll down to the about section, and either click on "Add a description" or the edit icon if one is already set.

2. Go back to your profile and click on "Create update"
