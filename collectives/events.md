* **Name** of the event
* **Short Description:** purpose, schedule, etc. Use something short (less than 255 characters). You'll be able to set a longer description directly on the event page after its creation.
* **Start** date & time
* **End** date & time
* **URL:** the online address your event will have - very important so you don't get a [404 error](events.md#i-cant-see-my-event-listed-or-get-a-404-error).
* **Location:** the address will load a map
* **Private instructions:** These instructions will be provided by email to the participants.&#x20;

#### Add Images

You'll need to host your image somewhere and link to it with markdown syntax. Use this [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images) if you're not sure how. The basic format is:

```
![](https://img.url)
```

The size of the image should be 750 px wide max.

#### Finally, click the "CREATE EVENT" button.

## Event Settings&#x20;

To access your event settings - click on the settings button on the right side of the page.&#x20;
