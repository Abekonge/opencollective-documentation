# Tiers

You may want to define the different amounts for Backers and Sponsors to contribute to your Collective.

To set these up, log in and go to 'edit Collective', and head to the 'Tiers' section.

#### Configuration for Tiers:

* **Type:** donation or ticket sale \(for [events](events.md)\)
* **Name:** e.g. _Backer,_ _Backer Plus, Silver Sponsor, Gold Sponsor_
* **Description:** What reward backers at this level get or what it means
* **Amount:** the price
* **Interval:** Once, monthly, or yearly
* **Quantity:** if you want the Tier to be limited \(for unlimited leave empty\)

To add more, click the blue "add another tier" button.

Don't forget to **save** your changes ****so they show up on your Collective page.
