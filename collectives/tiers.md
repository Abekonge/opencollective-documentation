# Tiers

When creating a Collective you may want to define the different amounts for Backers and Sponsors to contribute.

Log in and go to 'edit Collective', and head to the 'Tiers' section.

#### Configurations for Tiers:

* **Type:** donation or ticket sale
* **Name:** e.g. _Backer,_ _Backer Plus, Silver Sponsor, Gold Sponsor_
* **Description:** What reward backers at this level get or what it means
* **Amount:** the price
* **Interval:** Once, monthly, or yearly
* **Quantity:** if you want the Tier to be limited \(for unlimited leave empty\)

To add more, click the blue "add another tier" button.

Don't forget to save your changes ****so they show up on your Collective page.
