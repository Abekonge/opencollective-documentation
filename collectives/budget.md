# Transparent Budget

## Inside the platform

Collectives have transparent budgets, where all transactions are automatically reported. Everyone can see where the money comes from and what it's spent on. The Budget Section on the Collectives Page shows the most recent transactions alongside Todays Balance, Total Raised, Total Disbursed and Estimates Annual Budget.
