# Updates & Comms

## Updates

A lot of Collectives like to periodically email their Financial Contributors, to let them know what their donations are enabling, express thanks, or notify everyone of a change. Similarly, hosts often need to contact the administrators of the Collectives they are hosting.

To create an Update, go to your Collective page, head to the **Updates** section and click on **+ Create a new update**. Updates will be emailed and appear in the Updates section of your Collective page.

#### Target audience

If you're a fiscal host, you'll have the option to pick the target audience before publishing an update:

* **Notify everyone**: will notify the two categories above

## Contacting a Collective

Users can contact you via the contact form of your collective. It is linked in your collective page through the `Contact` button. The forms stands on `/{your-collective}/contact`. If you don't want to use this feature, please email us at `support@opencollective.com` and we'll disable it for you.
