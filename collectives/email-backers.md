# Email Backers

A lot of Collectives like to periodically email their backers, to let them know what their contributions are enabling, express thanks, or notify everyone of a change.

To email all your backers send an email to backers@$collective.opencollective.com

$collective = the name of your Collective, which appears in your Collective URL

Another option is to [export](data-export.md) the emails.
