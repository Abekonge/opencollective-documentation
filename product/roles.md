# Roles

Please use these roles when creating issues or support requests, instead of _user_ \(everyone is a user\)! 

### Backer

A Backer supports a Collective financially. 

They arrive at a Collective many ways:

* Search from [homepage](https://www.opencollective.com)
* [Discover page](http://opencollective.com/discover)
* Direct link to a Collective
* [Github badges on readme](../developers/readme-integration.md)
* Sponsor's page
* [BackYourStack](https://www.backyourstack.com)
* Our [blog](https://medium.com/open-collective) or newsletter

### Sponsor

A Sponsor is a company that supports a Collective financially, often at a higher tier. They may also want: brand exposure, access to or goodwill from a community, tangible benefits like support, or help with recruiting efforts. A Sponsor has also more complex requirements, because they are an [Organization](../backers-and-sponsors/organizations.md) with accounting and reporting needs.

### Core Contributor

Core Contributors are Collective admins. They started the Collective or are heavily involved. They are often community organizers or maintainers of open source projects. They want to make their communities sustainable financially, therefore activities that enable them to receive funds from Backers and Sponsors are first on their priority list. They use tools like [tiers](../collectives/tiers.md), goals and [social media sharing](../collectives/integrations.md#twitter-integration). Once on Open Collective, they are interested in managing and growing their communities by creating [events](../collectives/events.md) and [sending updates](../collectives/email-backers.md).

### Fiscal Host Admins

Admins of [Fiscal Hosts](../hosts/) manage the entities that provide Collectives with a way to receive and manage their funds. They are interested in the financial sustainability of their Collectives, as they provide the bank account that makes accepting money possible. Host admins want tools and workflows to manage their tasks \(like paying expenses and approving new Collectives\) easier, charge their fees, and keep a useful accounting system. They are often the first points of contact for the Core Contributors of Collectives they host, and many are super-users. 

### Event Attendees

Attendees are users that arrive to the platform to register to a Collective's event. They are likely to interact only at that level, and the flow through which they arrive is a direct link provided by the event organizers. They want a smooth, hassle-free experience, clear informations about the event, and ideally a pathway to stay in touch or become Backers.
