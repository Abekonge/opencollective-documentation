# Platform Comparison

What makes Open Collective different:

*  Fully transparency of where money comes from and where it goes
* Completely open source
* Designed for ongoing collaborations, not individual creators or one-off campaigns
* Offers [Fiscal Hosting](../hosts/) as a service, so projects don't need to legally incorporate or figure out taxes
