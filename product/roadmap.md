## **Key questions for prioritization** 

**This is what we ask ourselves to decide what gets done and what doesn't.** 

* Does this serve our mission? 
* Will this make us financially sustainable within a year?
* Is it feasible to build and maintain with our team and runway?
* Can this make us move faster?
* Does this increase quality and not technical debt?
* Will this bring us more Collective and financial contributors?
* Is this already solved elsewhere or is it our unique contribution?
* Can we measure the success of  this?
