## Email Notifications

Open Collective may send you email notifications regarding invoices, receipts, payments, and other information which your actions or actions in your collectives trigger on the platform. For instance, if you cancel your recurring donation to a collective, you will receive an email letting you know that this has occurred for your records.

As a Collective admin, you will also receive emails whenever someone submits an expense on your platform, and when someone comments on those expenses. There may be other situations relevant to administration that will trigger more emails. To unsubscribe from emails from a fiscal host, click on the unsubscribe link in the footer of those emails.

There is no way to currently unsubscribe from all emails.
