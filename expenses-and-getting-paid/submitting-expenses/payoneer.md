# Payoneer

### Using Payoneer on Open Collective

The preferred payment methods on the Open Collective platform are Bank Transfer and Paypal because they are the most reliable and easiest to use. Unfortunately, there are some countries where PayPal and Wise (which we use for international bank transfers) are not an option. When you are filling in an invoice and do not see your currency as an option for payment, this is likely because of banking regulations between the country your bank is in and the bank of the collective you are submitting the invoice/reimbursement to. If this happens, you might be able to use Payoneer to pay people or get paid.

### **Getting paid through Payoneer**

1. Register for an account on [Payoneer](https://www.payoneer.com/) as an individual or a business
2. Once your account has been approved, [sign in](https://myaccount.payoneer.com/) to Payoneer. \*_Note: the approval process can take up to 3 business days_
3. From the **Receive** menu, select **Receiving** accounts and choose an account to receive the payments
