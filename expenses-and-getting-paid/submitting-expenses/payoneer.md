# Payoneer

### Using Payoneer on Open Collective

The preferred payment methods on the Open Collective platform are Bank Transfer and Paypal because they are the most reliable and easiest to use. Unfortunately, there are some countries where PayPal and Wise (which we use for international bank transfers) are not an option. When you are filling in an invoice and do not see your currency as an option for payment, this is likely because of banking regulations between the country your bank is in and the bank of the collective you are submitting the invoice/reimbursement to. If this happens, you might be able to use Payoneer to pay people or get paid.

### **Getting paid through Payoneer**

5\. On Open Collective, when filing an Expense or Invoice, choose to be paid via bank account.  &#x20;

_**Please note**_&#x20;

Payoneer usually defaults to pay in USD. If the host you are filing an expense with is also based in the US, please select the option of 'Local bank account'. OSC and OCF are based in the US.

If the host is not based in the US, use SWIFT.
