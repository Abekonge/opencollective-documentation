# Core Contributors Guidelines

## Core contributors Guidelines:

**Be mindful of everyone else’s time:** don’t block others. Think about how someone can take over from you, don’t become a bottleneck.

**Seek advice** but make your call.

**Work in the open**. It saves a lot of time.

**Apply rough consensus**. You don’t need everyone to sign off on something.

**Go ahead**, results speak louder than words.

**Deliver.** Schedules are flexible but…

...**Show up for** \(online\) meetups, let the team know if you can’t make it.Trust by default, don’t break the trust. Don’t lie.

**Support and encourage contributions.** When someone contributes, it means they care.

**Take care of yourself**, it’s a marathon - not a sprint. Take care of each other. We are all doing our best.

Expect **review requests** to be replied  in 24h hours \(excluding weekends\), after this period you can merge.

Ensure you have **proper RFCs** for important changes

**You’re responsible** for deploying what you develop 

**It’s everyone’s responsibility to make sure we are all as autonomous as possible**.
