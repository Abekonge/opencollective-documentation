# Best practices and code guidelines



* The strings must be internationalized. See [/help/developers/translations](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/developers/translations)
* Whenever it's possible we must use `styled-components` to write styles. See [OC Styleguide](https://opencollective-styleguide.now.sh/)
* We're getting rid of `Bootstrap`. Please don't use it for new developments.
* When adding new dependencies, we use [fixed versions](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning).
* Icons must be imported from the [styled-icons](http://styled-icons.js.org/) library.
* Tests written with Cypress must follow our [good practices](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/developers/testing-with-cypress) conventions.
