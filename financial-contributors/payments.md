# Payments

## Financial contribution flow

![Screencast of the general contribution flow](../.gitbook/assets/peek-2021-01-21-17-51.gif)

## Payment options

#### Profile

Select who you'd like to pay asâ€”yourself as an individual, or an [Organization](organizations/) or [Collective](../collectives/collectives.md) you manage.

You can also contribute anonymously by making an incognito contribution. If you chose to contribute as "incognito", your financial contribution will not show up publicly linked to your profile. However, administrators can privately see which profiles are attached to incognito contributions.&#x20;

You can find the option to donate incognito (anonymously) on the second step of the contributions page:

#### Payment info

1. Credit card - enter the details or use a saved card
2. [Gift card](organizations/gift-cards.md) - select the gift card you want to pay with
3. Collective - contribute [using the balance of one of your Collectives](collective-to-collective.md) (if it's in the same host as the one you're donating to)
4. [Organization](organizations/) - contribute using the balance saved to your Organization
5. Bank transfer, Paypal, or other method if made available by that Collective and their fiscal host.&#x20;

If you don't make a bank transfer, the pending order will expire and no further action is required.

## Recurring financial contributions (subscriptions)

### Why do you charge recurring monthly subscriptions on 1st of every month?

It helps Collectives manage their monthly budget and is more predictable for them. We're working on a way to charge a single payment spread out across monthly contributions, to reduce payment processor transaction fees.

### When will I be billed next time?

You will be charged when you first contribute, and then on the 1st of each month (for monthly contributions) or the 1st of the same month next year (for yearly contributions). Note: To prevent you from being charged twice in a short time frame, if you contribute after the 15th of a given month, the next charge will not be the 1st of next month but the month after.

## Contributing as a guest

If you start the contribution flow (ie. [http://opencollective.com/babel/donate](http://opencollective.com/babel/donate)) while being logged out, the system will allow you to continue without signing in/up, just by providing your email address. Note that guest accounts are not automatically anonymous- you need to not put your name in under "Full Name," i.e. write "guest" or "anonymous," otherwise it will show up along with the transaction. For information about submitting a contribution anonymously (incognito) if you already have an Open Collective profile, [see above](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/payments#profile).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Above a certain amount, the system will ask you additional information such as your physical address. This information is required for legal purpose, and stays private.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Guest contributions are not yet supported for recurring contributions or in case the email that you're trying to use is already a verified account on Open Collective. We are currently working on removing these limitations.
{% endhint %}

#### 2. By signing in

Sign in directly by clicking on the "Sign in" button in the top navbar will have the same effect of verifying your account directly.

## Payment changes

To view your current payment methods, go to your profile (under 'my account') and click 'edit profile', then 'payment methods'.

### Save a new credit card for future transactions

Go to manage payment methods in your profile settings and select "add another payment option". If you add a new card, you will have it as an option to make future contributions.

_**Note:** Adding a new card does not change the card for existing recurring contributions._

### Change the amount, payment method or cancel an existing contribution

Open the dropdown menu next to your profile avatar and click on **Manage Contributions.**
