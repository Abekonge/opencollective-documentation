# Funds

We wanted to make it easier for organisations to support multiple projects. 

As opposed to a creating a [collective](../../about/terminology.md#collectives), **Funds** is primarily designed for disbursing money, e.g., through grant-making. If you are more focused on disbursing funds than receiving them, a **Fund** may be a good fit for you.

{% hint style="success" %}
Know how much money the Fund has, approve or invite grant requests, easily request disbursements from your charitable Fund.
{% endhint %}

A **Fund** includes:

* a streamlined, single payer process for supporters
* support for communities operating on Open Collective or elsewhere
* a lightweight 'Request a Grant' process for projects issue money to grant recipients
* Transparent financial management on the Open Collective Platform
* More flexibility with what you choose to publicly show \(in terms of expense management\)
  * Protect identities of those receiving grants

    * e.g. emergency relief aid may not want to be as public
      * Will still be reported and available to fiscal host



**Who can create a Fund?** 

Funds can be created by an organisation. 

**Funds** allows for more customization in the transparency of an initiative. This is a great way to issue grants to recipients of emergency aid, human rights activists and censorship targets, for example, for whom more privacy is essential. 

It's also perfect for initiatives who want it to be easier to distribute money _outside_ of Open Source Collective. **Funds** is the best way to manage your FOSS support fund to projects in or out of your OSC fund since you'll **only need to deal with one vendor** \(us!\). 

With **Funds**, we can now offer more flexibility for managing finances and expenses.

{% hint style="info" %}
A **Fund** is likely less interested in the 'social' & crowdfunding aspects of fundraising. This type of account will have a more simplified version of our dashboard for those who don't want all the extra features that group-organizing benefits from. 
{% endhint %}
