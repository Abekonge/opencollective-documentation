# Local Tax Support

In certain countries or regions, Fiscal Hosts are required to collect local taxesâ€”for example, VAT in the EU.

We currently support VAT for European products, services and events. Tax will automatically apply if you create an event in a country of the European Union or if you add a `SERVICE` or `PRODUCT` tier while your collective is registered in a EU country.

Please contact support@opencollective.com if you need Collectives under your umbrella to charge taxes. We will work with you to conform to you local legislation.
