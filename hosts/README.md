# Fiscal Hosts

## What is a fiscal host?

A fiscal host is a legal company or individual who holds a Collective’s funds in their bank account, and can generate invoices and receipts for backers and sponsors. You can think of a fiscal host as an umbrella organization for the Collectives in it.

The fiscal host is responsible for taxes, accounting, compliance, and financial admin, and paying expenses approved by the Collective’s core contributors \(admins\). Fiscal hosting enables Collectives to transact financially without needing to legally incorporate. In other contexts, this is sometimes called _fiscal sponsorship_.

The Open Collective platform makes the job of fiscal hosts process easier by providing reports and automating bookkeeping and bill paying tasks. Fiscal hosts have a dashboard where they can see their Collectives and perform common actions like paying expenses.

By sharing a host, Collectives are effectively mutualizing the cost and overhead of having a legal entity.

## What are some examples of fiscal hosts?

Hosts can be in any location and take any form of legal entity \(as long as they have a bank account, Paypal account, and Stripe account\). Each one determines its own policies for which Collectives it will host and what fees it will charge. Below are the hosts that Open Collective manages, plus some more examples.

| Fiscal Host | Hosted Collectives | Fee |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Open Source Collective | Open source projects | 5% |
| Open Collective Foundation | US-based charity projects | 5% |
| Open Collective Inc | Our own transparent budget | 0% |
| Open Collective Europe ASBL | EU-based collectives | 5% |
| Open Collective Paris | Paris-based collectives | 0% |
| Brussels Together | Brussels-based citizen initiatives | €10/month |
| Women Who Code | Local chapters worldwide | 0% |

## Why are there different fiscal hosts?

Some projects can’t be fiscally hosted by the entities Open Collective runs itself, because they are in a country we don’t cover or don’t fit under our entities' missions \(for example, Open Source Collective is only for Open Source software projects, and Open Source Foundation is US-only charity projects\). We want to enable all kinds of diverse Collectives, so we make our platform available to a network of fiscal hosts with different missions in different geographies. Each fiscal host determines its own policies and fees.

## Do all Collectives need a fiscal host?

Every collective that receives or pays out money needs a fiscal host, because they need to connect the host's bank account, Stripe account, and Paypal account to activate Open Collective’s payment features. If you already have a legal company set up, or you are comfortable taking on the responsibility as an individual, you can fiscally host your own Collective.

## Where can I see all the active fiscal hosts?

Go to the host’s page and click “Apply to create a Collective”. You can see [all hosts here](https://opencollective.com/hosts).

## I'm a fiscal host. Where does money contributed to my Collectives go?

Straight to the bank account attached to your Stripe account, which you connect when you set up as an Open Collective fiscal host.

## How do people withdraw funds from Collectives we host?

To get the money out, people submit receipts or invoices as [Expenses](../expenses/). Then it goes through a two-step approval process. First, a core contributor \(admin\) of the individual Collective confirms that the expense is a valid use of funds. Then you, as host admin, confirm the expense meets your requirements \(such as having a valid receipt\). 

When you click "pay", the funds are automatically sent via Paypal to the person who submitted the expense. The host dashboard shows you all the information and available actions in one place.

## What payment methods do you support to pay out expenses?

Right now, we only support PayPal and "manual" as payout methods. Manual means that you can manually record any money that you received or sent outside of the Open Collective platform \(e.g. bank transfer, crypto currency, cash, etc.\). In the future, we hope to build the ability to pay via bank transfer, cryptocurrency, and other methods into the platform.

## How to pay out Expenses with PayPal?

From your host dashboard you can connect your PayPal account, and pre-approve up to $2,000 USD in payouts. Make sure that you are connecting the PayPal account connected to the same bank account as your Stripe account.

On the host dashboard, expenses that have been approved for Collectives with sufficient budget will show a "pay" button. With just one click you can pay the expense. After paying out $2,000, you'll need to re-authorize with PayPal \(this is a security feature\). 

For single payments larger than $2,000, you can change the type to "manual" and pay via PayPal or any other method, and then record the expense as paid in Open Collective.
