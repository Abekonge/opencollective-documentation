# Different ways to get funding

It is important that you check with your host \(fiscal sponsor\) if these options are available to you. 

### Ethical Advertising

We need to shift gears and think about how OSS can leverage the tangible benefits it provides companies. Speaking to super niche audiences, like developers, in their own environment might be one of them.  

Some ideas are using CodeFund, Carbon Ads or referral fee solutions like Triplebyte's.

We [wrote a blogpost](https://medium.com/open-collective/using-ads-to-sustain-open-source-d048b75d4979) about this. 

### Swag Shop

A great way to get contributions and give something to your contributors is having a swag shop. Collectives have been using [threadless](https://webpack.threadless.com/mens/t-shirt/regular), [bonfire](https://www.bonfire.com), [teezily](https://www.teezily.com/stores/voltshop) and [cotton bureau](https://cottonbureau.com/products/parcel-t-shirt#/1402774/tee-men-standard-tee-vintage-navy-tri-blend-s). 

### Affiliations 

Some projects can participate in affiliate programs. For example Material-UI is receives funding from their themes in [Creative Tim Affiliates](https://www.creative-tim.com/affiliates/new). 

A contributor could also start a [workshop in Academy ](https://webpack.academy/)and they could choose to get paid and ideally return a % to the community. 

### Offer access to support 

Some collectives have created a Base Support Tier that gives Sponsors access to some support hours per month in exchange for a yearly contribution. [Babel is one of them](https://opencollective.com/babel).

Priority answer to issues is something you can also offer you sponsors. The new [open collective bot ](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective-bot/)should make that easier.

### Offer your top sponsors to set up Bounties on their behalf. 

You can offer your top sponsors to set up bounties for features they'd like that you don't have time/resources to prioritize. We [interviewed](https://medium.com/open-collective/jhipsters-bounty-system-and-how-it-saved-the-project-cc118888f642) JHipster about their bounty program that does this.

### Offer your top sponsors voting rights

Webpack has been experimenting with this \(we should do a blogpost about it\) through [their voting system](https://webpack.js.org/vote). They give sponsors special influence when voting their roadmap.
