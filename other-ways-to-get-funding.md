# Other ways to get funding

It is important that you check with your host \(fiscal sponsor\) if these options are available to you. 

### Ethical Advertising

We need to shift gears and think about how OSS can leverage the tangible benefits it provides companies. Speaking to super niche audiences, like developers, in their own environment might be one of them.  

Some ideas are using CodeFund, Carbon Ads or referral fee solutions like Triplebyte's.

We [wrote a blogpost](https://medium.com/open-collective/using-ads-to-sustain-open-source-d048b75d4979) about this. 

### Swag Shop

A great way to get contributions and give something to your contributors is having a swag shop. Collectives have been using [threadless](https://webpack.threadless.com/mens/t-shirt/regular), [bonfire](https://www.bonfire.com), [teezily](https://www.teezily.com/stores/voltshop) and [cotton bureau](https://cottonbureau.com/products/parcel-t-shirt#/1402774/tee-men-standard-tee-vintage-navy-tri-blend-s). 

### Affiliations 

Some projects can participate in affiliate programs. For example Material-UI is receives funding from their themes in [Creative Tim Affiliates](https://www.creative-tim.com/affiliates/new). 

A contributor could also start a [workshop in Academy ](https://webpack.academy/)and they could choose to get paid and ideally return a % to the community.
