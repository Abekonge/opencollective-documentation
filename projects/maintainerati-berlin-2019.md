# Maintainerati Berlin 2019

Open Collective is partnering with Maintainerati this year!

For this occasion, we're distributing 25$ Gift Cards to each participant. 

### Can I donate to any collectives?

Unfortunately not.This Gift Card is issued in partnership with the [Open Source Collective 501c6](https://opencollective.com/opensourcecollective) \(Non Profit\) and is limited to collectives hosted by this fiscal host. This is a technical limitation, it would have been complicated to open it to any collectives. Hopefully, most \(but not all\) Open Source projects are hosted there.

### How long is the card valid?

The card expires exactly 1 month after the event. Even if redeemed, you will not be able to donate after this date. Hurry up!

### Can I use it for recurring subscriptions \(monthly, yearly\)?

While it's technically possible, due to the close expiry it's not recommended. Recurring payments will fail after the expiry date and your subscription will be automatically canceled unless you update it with another payment method. For this reason, we recommend to stick to one time donations.

### I redeemed with the wrong Open Collective account, can you help?

Yes. Please contact [support](http://opencollective.com/support) and we should be able to troubleshoot that.
